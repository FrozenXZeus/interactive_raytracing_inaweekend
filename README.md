# Welcome to my implementation of: Ray Tracing in a Weekend

Got this done on a Saturday, typed out everything in a hurry, probably buggy.
Not representative of code I write in production.

Thanks to [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle) for the basic triangle code and Peter Shirley for the Ray Tracing in a Weekend code

(Also Thanks to all the stb contributors for stb_image_write.h)
